Approach & Methodology 

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking to analyze traffic in real-time. The system processes video input from either a webcam or a file, detects vehicles, tracks them across frames, and maintains count statistics for different vehicle types. The GUI provides an interactive interface for users to select input sources and visualize results.
